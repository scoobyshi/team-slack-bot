## Team Slack Bot
This utility is meant to run in the background as a Slack Bot, and answer the question of who in the Slack Team is online, etc.  This utility could also be used on a schedule to notify the team of everyone's status.  

## Example Uses

- If your team have a discipline of updating their status daily to "On Vacation", "Work from Home", "Sick", then you could run this, for example, at 9:30am, pointing to the General channel, so that everyone, at a glance, would understand who is sick, away, etc.
- Your team could query the bot ad-hoc to know who is sick today
